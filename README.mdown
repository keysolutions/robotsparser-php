RobotsParser
============

RobotsParser is a PHP class which parses the contents of a robots.txt file to determine which paths are not permitted to be crawled. ROBOT_USER_AGENT_PATTERN should be replaced with the user agent regular expression pattern your crawler should match.

Example Usage
-------------

$parser = new RobotsParser($contents_of_robots_txt);
$parser->disallowed_paths();

The disallowed_paths function returns an array of disallowed paths which match the given user agent.
